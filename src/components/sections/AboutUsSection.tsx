            Living in a multi-generational home, (with more people in our house
            than we had bedrooms for – due to high rental prices), we quickly
            found ourselves drowning in extra rubbish that didnt fit in the
            council bins, no matter how much we recycled or reused. So, every
            week, we would drive out of town just to get rid of our overflow. Then
            it hit us – not everyone can make that drive, and we noticed some
            folks turning to sneaky roadside dumping for their extra bags.

            Thats when Clean Sweep Duo was born! We are a mother-daughter team
            with a mission: to make rubbish removal simple, affordable, and,
            dare we say, a bit friendlier. We may only have a small car to start
            this mission but we have a big goal - to help others clear out their
            home clutter and keep the streets clean—one bag at a time!
